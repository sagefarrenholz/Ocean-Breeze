# Ocean-Breeze
An ocean themed Alacritty theme.

## Design
Using a color analysis program, the dominant colors from a night time beach image were turned into this theme. The oranges and bright purpely colors pop the most, just as a sunset would. The muted background colors are paler yellows and gentle blues, similar to that of the beach and sky. Enjoy.
